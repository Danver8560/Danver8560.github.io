          <p> Hello! My name is Daniel Verdugo. I am a senior at Palm Desert High School, and am currently taking the Computer Science Principles Class, mostly to learn a little about basics of computer sciences, as well as a bit of coding, and maybe even find some sort of job interest in the future. </p>
          <p> I have am also a major band nerd, as I have been part of band since 7th grade, playing the French Horn. Out of the six years, I have been in the marching band since 8th grade, where I the many benefits of band really started to pick pick. I became more social, making many new friends, such as my best friend Kyle, and I even got the chance to go to Europe! Specifially Barcelona, Spain and Paris, France. We stayed in each city for four days, viewing many famous places, such as the Louvre in Paris, and La Sagrada Familia, a very architechually advanced church, with a couple of pictures below. </p>
