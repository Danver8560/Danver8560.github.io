              <p> My Partner Kyle and I worked on making a Red-Light Green-Light Game setup 
                  using the Arduino Board. To achieve this, we used four RGB LED's, 1 IR Remote, 
                  and many jumper wires. We faced many difficulties while making the baord, most 
                  of which carried relatively simple solutions. To start, we were going to begin 
                  with Red and Green LED's, but this would mean we could only use two of each.
                  That is, until we found out we could use RGB LED's, summing up to four LED's 
                  that would be the same colors all at the same time. Our biggest problem did not 
                  arrive until we began to impliment the IR Remote. Immediately after connecting
                  the Reciever to the circuit, it did not want to work. In fact, we began to smell 
                  something funky, and realised we hooked up the 5V and recieving pins. We fixed that
                  but still nothing was showing that the reciever was working. And so we decided to 
                  unplug the whole board, and redo the wiring. We still met the same problem. It was 
                  until another day passed that we realized we left the IR remote untouched the entire
                  and by clicking the buttons would show the IR reciever DOES work. Great. An entire 
                  three days wasted because we could not read instructions. But I digress. Now, knowing 
                  the Reciever works, we finally worked on the code, or should I say myself, as Kyle 
                  wanted the rewire the board just so it would look more pleasing, and having done three
                  times now, was pretty easy for him to do. Coding for me was quite easy, I had to  
                  write a code that would change the color of the LED depending on what color is pressed. 
                  If Button 1 is pressed, the LEDs would change Red. If Button 2 is pressed, the LEDs 
                  will change Green. </p>
