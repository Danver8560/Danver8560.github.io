              <h2> Python Project - World War II Quiz</h2>
              <br>
              <p>The video below shows our Python project which is a randomized quiz that is 
                  related to WW2. When the question is answered correctly, it moves to the next 
                  question. When the question is not answered correctly, the program will continue 
                  to ask the user the same question that they answered incorrectly.</p>
              <p>The project was completed and programmed by Shun Akiya and Daniel Verdugo. 
                 The projects theme is around a randomized quiz where users answer 10 randomized 
                 questions that are related to World War II. While we were programming the quiz, 
                 there were definitely some difficulties that we encountered. The 1st problem was 
                 not implementing a while loop. In the beginning, we completed our program with 
                 everything that was needed; but we completely forgot to add a while loop somewhere
                 in the program. We resolved this problem by coming up with a clever idea, which 
                 was implementing a while loop so that every time the player answers a question with
                 with out typing A, B, C or D, the program will just repeat the question until the
                 user answers with a valid input. The 2nd problem that we encountered was implementing 
                 the randomizer in the program, which we soon found out that it was a very simple solution. 
                 The solution was to replace the original randomizer we had before, print(random.shuffle(function)), 
                 to print(random.shuffle(function)). The part of the program that Shun worked on was coming 
                 up with the questions, the while loops for the quiz, and the some of the question functions.
                 The part of the program that Daniel worked on was coming up with the questions, figuring out 
                 the randomization of the questions and the rest of the question functions.</p>
